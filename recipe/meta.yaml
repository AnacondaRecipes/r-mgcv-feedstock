  summary: Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their extensions and  other generalized
    ridge regression with multiple smoothing  parameter estimation by (Restricted) Marginal
    Likelihood,  Generalized Cross Validation and similar. Includes a gam()  function,
    a wide variety of smoothers, JAGS support and  distributions beyond the exponential
    family.
